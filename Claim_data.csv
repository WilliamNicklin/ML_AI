"the water pipe that connects to mixer shower up in bathroom broke behind the wall at point of entry into the mixer shower.    Water escaped down the back of the shower wall into the kitchen ceiling below.    With the breakage behind the shower wall, a lot of water continued to escape until it could be shut off.  The valve that feeds the mixer shower is not in an accessible place, it was behind the wall between bathroom and upstairs landing.   The easiest way to get to the valve was to open up the landing way wall space to get into the valve to stop the last of the water continuing into the kitchen.  The water flow was vast and has led to damage in the kitchen ceiling and that then went through onto kitchen floor. The water seems to have also damaged the kitchen floor tiles, which now have grout coming out,movement of tiles and cracking.      The kitchen, and that floor was installed in May/June 2016 so isn't old.

"In the storming the night of 29/12/17, a very large part of a tree (25-30ft) from our neighbours house (12 Coppice walk, London N20, owner Mr M Rosenberg, back fence neighbour), has fallen in to our back garden and onto our shed. There is damage to our shed and fences and we cannot get access to the shed at present to fully understand the extent of the damage. Currently a third of our garden is covered with the tree making the garden unsafe to access, part of this is leaning on to the shed which may be causing further damage to the shed. We wrote to Mr Rosenberg the morning of Saturday 30/12 with a hand delivered letter advising him that it is his responsibility to sort and amend the damage. Mr Rosenberg has responded (by text the evening of 30/12) saying “thank you for your note, i see the branch overhanging your garden has broken, probably in the recent high winds.I could not see damage to your shed, though if there is, this will be a matter for your property  insurance. My gardener is due to visit in January. If you don’t have a gardener, I can ask him to visit if you wish - he’s very good and will be able to cut and clear the tree (and in fact repair any shed damage) - he removed a tree from my front garden recently - I doubt it would cost you more than £150-£200.” This suggests he has not taken any responsibility for the removal of the tree or the damage caused. This tree has been poorly maintained and was also subject to a fire 4 years ago (20/4/13, fire brigade was called out as fire spread in to 3 Gardens), caused by Mr Rosenberg’s negligence when disposing of hot ash leaving it unattended and by the tree in his back garden; this set his tree and our fence alight. The part of the tree that has fallen was damaged through the fire, still clearly showing the damage and scorch marks from the fire & should have been removed at that time. At no time since Mr Rosenberg  has moved in in 2007 has his tree been pruned back and we have a number of large, heavy overhanging branches which may also in future fall in to our garden. This is particularly worrying as the tree has been visibly damaged by the fire with no effort having been made to make this safe. This adds further risk for future storms. Our claim is for the safe removal of the tree and any damage to the shed and fences be made good ASAP. We have taken photos of the damage and tree which we are happy to send to you or you may wish for someone to visit the property.",TREEFALL

I checked with a torch to the best of my ability (removed the kickboards) to try find the source, but to no avail. I couldn't hear any dripping or gushing noises, and my boiler was fine so I was going out of my mind trying to figure out where it was coming from!! When I was outside de-snowing my car, waiting for a plumber to get back to me, the neighbours mentioned that the vacant property next to me, number 35 North Road, had one of their back windows blown open on the ground floor and snow had piled up in the property. It was then realised that perhaps all the snow was leaking somehow into my property from theirs. When two neighbours in my street came to have a look at my flooding, including a plumber, they jumped over the back wall into number 35's garden to look through the window and water was gushing from the ceiling! I called the letting agency immediately and spoke to Paul who was the emergency contact, and he got hold of the landlord/owner. In the time between calling Paul and the landlord arriving, one of my neighbours had dug open his water meter (outside the property and was covered in snow) and managed to turn off the water to his property - turns out one of his pipes had burst and as the property was vacant, he had no idea until I called.

I gave the police a statement of what happened and was referred to a detective who informed me (and showed me), that CCTV shows a woman place her coat over the bag, then look in the bag and with a delay, take the bag to lost and found!!! The detective was adamant she took the cash! I gave the police a copy of the receipt from my local post office where I had purchased the euros the day before. I have a signed statement from the police, the security bag to which my document bag was placed, the receipt from the post office and the receipt from Thomas Cook.",THEFTSPECIFIED

This claim is related to the one already made which was refused by you as storm could not have caused the damage as presented.  Obviously something happened to cause the damage while no one was at home. We were therefore forced to look further into the events.  The pictures taken by the builder who was called to the scene to repair the aftermath of the incident proved very useful and with this we started our investigation.  The pictures clearly show that the bifold door had been locked as I have maintained but they also show a large pile of leaves in the garden and also a pile of rubbish. This got us thinking and so we decided to investigate further as it did not make sense that a huge bifold was on the floor pushed by the wind while and a pile of rubbish was still in situ.  Although we were away my son was not and workers still looking after property. Builder confirmed that he visited property either Tuesday or Wednesday before the storm to dispose of the rubbish that you is shown on the picture. Our two gardners confirmed that they visited the property on the Thursday before the storm hence the pile of leaves seen on the picture.  They also confirmed that the bifold door was open on the Thursday when they arrived and so thought that my son was off work. This unfortunately was not so since my son had left on Monday morning and did not return to the property until late on Friday.   I then spoke to window fitter who confirmed that the wind would not have caused the bifold to be thrown into the garden but in the hands of a knowledgeable person it is easy to derail a Bifold door without damaging anything.  In fact the window fitter said that it is easier to derail  a bifold door than open an ordinary window.  Horrified we checked around the house and saw damage done to the back door which was not there previously as well as lots of marks on the bifold door.  Therefore between the time that the builder disposed of the rubbish either Tuesday or Wednesday and the gardeners came on Thursday 11th October someone tried to get into our home.  Whoever it was knew our whereabouts and knew how to get into our garden without being spotted. We suspect that this can only be someone from a housing estate that was being built last year on a field to the side of our house. We have cameras pointing towards the front of the house and so who ever entered our property entered from the back which is easily acessbible from the building site that also has the expertise to know how to derail a bifold door. We have reported this to the police and been given a crime number of 45190016330.  Under the circumstances we apologise for giving you the wrong reason for the incident but because it happened while we were away and it had been extremely windy we naturally assumed this to be the cause of the problem.,BURGLARY

"I was at my parents home, my husband was at work, my mother in law (CJA) was in the garden, at the back by the garage gardening. This was approximately between 2.30-4.30pm. The backdoor was closed, but not locked, everything else was locked. CJA, after gardening for approx 2 hours, then came into the house, she came in via the front door (went through garage, and then round the front as was taking garden waste in the wheely bin). She got to front of the house and noticed porch door was open, but assumed maybe the post man had been, or the wind had blown it. Front main doorwas intact, and she opened using her key. She made a tea, and fed the dog. After an 60-90 mins (approx 6pm) she went to the kitchen to turn heating on, went to get something from her handbag (on the kitchen table) but her large purse (Black, fold over ""Hermes Dogon duo combined"", containing debit cards and approx £30 cash) was missing, along with a letter she had placed next to it to the DVLA. She thought this was strange so went to her bedroom in case she had put it there, when she got to her bedroom upstairs her wardrobe doors were wide open. Immediately she saw that her medium sized red leather vanity case (which is over 40 years old, containing Jewlery of very sentimental value - pieces left to her by her mother, and a lockett with an inscription bought for her and given to her from her husband after he died of cancer, along with pieces left by her  deceased inlaws) was not there. This is when she realised there had been a burglary. She called my husband (BA), who then called myself. When we both arrived home BA approx 1940, myself 2000), we looked round the house for evidence of break in, and to see if any of our items were missing. All doors and windows were intact without damage, side gate was locked. Only item missing of my property was an iPad, which was bought in December 2018 (for which I have receipts from john lewis, pro 12.9"" a12x bionic ios wifi 256gb silver ), this iPad was by the front door on a ledge in a black leather case. We calmed my mother in law down, and decided to go to our local police station (sutton). We were then visited by 2 police officers around 10pm who took statements. Current reference is CAD8641/29mar19. Missing Jewlery of my mother in law - gold locket with inscription (Stay strong, love you forever Snuggs), bought in August 2017 (a month before her husband died, reciept attached costing £1,195), some diamond earrings left to her by her mother in law, silver necklace left to her by her mother, late husbands wedding ring, mothers engagement ring (5 diamond), father-in-laws solid gold watch which was left to her late husband (brand unknown), CJA's dupont lighter (over 40 years old, gold lighter) and other costume jewlery of CJA of smaller monetary value.",BURGLARY

"Plumber cane out as the first floor shower was leaking. As the shower tray is floor standing the shower enclosure had to be removed and the tray lifted. He discovered the floor underneath the shower had areas unsupported but thought this could be sorted by bracing the area. There was some movement and the tray was not supported by joists which were spaced wider than the tray. He then decided that just replacing the floor and reinforcing the area directly under the shower would mean future issues. The following day we had another plumber take a look and he elected without the whole floor being lifted , fully braced and relaid the shower would leak again in a short while as there would be movement and the seals would break. The fuse box is directly below the shower so any leaks would go straight into the electrics. The rough estimated cost to rectify is circa 2.5 k to include new floor covering but not including a replacement shower enclosure if original one can be reused but no formal quote yet requested or provided. The shower tray and enclosure has been left out.",ESCAPEWATER

I've answered the door and then gone back to my TV which sounded like it was still on but the screen was black, I've put it back on the cabinet and then turned it off at the wall socket before going over to my laptop to pick it up and see if it's ok. The laptop has a pressure mark on the screen where I trod on it and there are small dents and scratches on the top of the laptop. The mouse trackpad also doesn't seem to be working properly as it keeps intermittently scrolling all over the screen on it's own when the laptop is on charge.

"Yesterday, the 13th October 2019 our next door neighbours at 93 Ardington Road, Northampton, unfortunately had a fire in their attic. The fire brigade were called and they started to put the fire out. The fire by this time was in their roof of the house so they had to remove a large area of roof tiles both at the side and the front of our neighbour's house to get at the fire. The fire appeared to be getting under control and a fire man asked if he could check in our adjoining attic for any possible further damage. He tested the adjoining attic wall for heat and could see a very hot area at the top of the wall at the front of the house. The fire brigade then removed more tiles on our side of the roof and further flames shot up from where the adjoining attic wall met the front of the roof of our houses. This was quickly put out but left us also with roof damage. I have spoken to our neighbours today, 14th October 2019, and they said that they had spoken to their insurers and have been told that we must contact yourselves with all these details to arrange for repairing work to be done through yourselves and that then you can claim back all costs from themselves.

We called the same company - basically they hadn't secured the radiator properly and it was leaking. The engineer said that the person who did the first one has now left and obviously didn't do it properly. The engineer fixed our boiler which had a leak apparently when trying to pressurize. The fix was temporary as he didn't have the right parts. They said they would come back to fix it, now refuse.

This has waterlogged the insulation, which has then caused the ceilling to collapse due to the heavy weight of the insulation. The insulation fell through the celine on to the bed and floor.

"Probably easier to describe as a timeline:  29/3                       Around  6pm used slow cooker (which was sat on top of cooker) and the oven part of the cooker unit for dinner. All turned off once done. Tea towels and slow cooker left atop of oven on hob area – but hob has not been used since the 28th. Went to bed later that night. 30/3                       Woke around 8 – bedroom upstairs, straight into the shower. Then went downstairs into living room to call nephew for his birthday (do not go into kitchen as part of this journey) – noted a slight burning smell. Have a log fire,  assumed it was from that. After maybe 5 minutes burning smell gets stronger, fire alarm sounds. Note the room has become smokey – walk into hallway and see kitchen is very smoky. Walk into kitchen, there are flames atop the oven – the tea towels have caught fire. This in turn has melted the front of the slow cooker. Pick up kettle which is next to it, go to pour water onto flames – check the hob dials and the wall cooker socket before doing so – dials are off, socket is on so this is turned off – pour water over fire. Does not work. Sweep the burning matter onto the floor to try and stamp it out – some goes out, some does not – using some wood pick up the other burning parts and run outside, throw on patio and bucket of water over the top. At this stage I have assumed it to be slow cooker – and had set the kettle down onto the hob. Came back in to then pick up kettle to find it has now melted onto the hob (rear right ring) which makes me check slow cooked to see it is also off at wall. My vinyl floor is now burned, as are some kitchen units – slow cooker and kettle destroyed, and oven has melted and burned matter atop on hob – remains off and will not turn back on.",FIRE

"Firstly, this is not an exact date because this is not a known fact. My water supplier - Southern Water - advise that we are using too much water. I have had a plumber check my house internally. All is good. He and a representative from Southern Water suggest that there is a leak in the underground pipe between my internal stop cock and that on the main supply pipe. Southern Water say that this pipe is mine and therefore I need to employ a company to investigate the source of the leak and satisfactorily repair it. I am awaiting a quotation from such a company. There is though, one further complication. My water pipe runs underground from the mains, through my neighbour's garden and onward into my property. He is unwilling to have a company on his land and suggests we re-route our water pipe around his property. Whilst his being uncooperative is annoying, I have to say that the likelihood is that the cost of investigation and repair will be not disimilar to laying a new pipe. The latter is, of course, much quicker. Your advice please. Stuart Lee",ESCAPEWATER

I tried to see how wet the chipboard was and it was completely sodden. I put my hand right through one of them (as you can see in the photos). the floor is soft in several places and the leak has covered at least a couple of square metres This definitely looks like it is far too big a job for me.

I (Ken) came home from work at 15.30 to find the bathroom flooded. The fountain tap at the sink was trickling but unfortunately the design of the sink meant it had been pouring over the edge onto the tiled floor and this would more than likely have been  since 08.00 when Sally left for work. we soaked up the water allowed the bathroom to air /dry out as best we could. Unfortunately over the following week the wood flooring beneath the tiles started to swell causing tiles to crack and the floor to move underfoot. The toilet is also now making a creaking sound when used.,ESCAPEWATER

"I live in a terraced property.   On three occasions, during Jan / Feb 2020 the next-door neighbour brought to my attention some slipped slates on my property roof. She was concerned the weather would get in and then spread to her roof. I am unsure whether this is possible due to the L shaped layout of the two properties.  On the third occasion, she stopped us at my front door and invited my brother and me onto her flat roof to slip the tiles back in place. The flat roof is approx 30ft x 20ft. To keep the peace we took the ladders and she allowed us to climb on her flat roof to adjust the tiles. On doing so the ladder slipped and caused a shallow tear the size of a 5 pence piece. We duly notified her of the slight damage and told her we would repair the tear with the appropriate glue. She quickly told us she wanted us to replace the whole flat roof, not just the 5p sized shallow tear.   This seemed unreasonable so we suggested we get an independent builder to come to quote for the tear. She refused and instead asked her family friend who is a builder to quote for a new roof. The quote came back as 4k. However, her builder said the flat roof did not need replacing and he would just fix the shallow tear. She asked me to pay for the tear damage and gave me the Invoice which was 75.00 and I happily paid. She was satisfied with this and the work her builder did.  After the repair in Feb we heard nothing more about it. Last week, seven months after the repair, the neighbour alerted me to the fact that the glue her builder used to repair the damage had lifted due to the heatwave and her ceiling beneath was damp. She told me I would now need to pay for the entire flat roof to be replaced. She asked for my insurance details, which I gave.    Fyi. To my knowledge, the roof was replaced 2 years ago by a handyman/builder and the owner who is not a qualified builder.  When raining the flat roof fills with rainwater and has deep and wide pockets of puddles all over the roof. It doesn't look as if there is a gradient for the water to drain away and so the rainwater collects.    I have already paid for her builder to repair the damage we accidentally caused after we were invited on to the roof. Seven months on there is a fault with the work he did. Am I liable to replace the whole flat roof? Shouldn't the builder be responsible for making good the job I paid him for?",PLPROPERTY

I was collecting my daughter from nursery when she pulled my face mask off. I then got in the car to collect my other daughter from school and then drove home. When I got home I noticed one of my diamond stud ear-rings I had been wearing was missing. I retraced my steps and visited the places I had been but was unable to locate the ear-ring. My husband also went later to check but couldn’t find it either. I have contacted the school and nursery and posted on the school Facebook page about the loss but no one has come forward to say they have found it. I believe that when my daughter pulled my face mask off it either pulled the ear-ring out or it pulled the back off and it fell out later. We have also thoroughly searched the car. I have attached a photograph of both ear-rings together prior to the loss. I have also attached the GIA certificates for both ear-rings as I am unsure which one was lost.,ADSPECIFIED

"We found out that our builder Graeme Nigel Giles a director and owner of the company Ringwood Building Services Ltd that was doing the renovations / building on our home since June 2020 had fraudulently misrepresented himself to us as a Qualified Builder with 25 + years experience and only used qualified tradespeople was actually only a cowboy who has caused untold damage to our property . Graham Nigel Giles intended for us to rely on his fraudulent misrepresentation of himself and as a result we have suffered a substantial monitory loss. Had he not fraudulently misrepresented himself as a qualified builder with all the relevant expertise to to the job we would absolutely not have hired him. He contacted us on 07/01/2021 to say he was going into liquidation , only a couple of days after we had yet again questioned his work and videoed the so called qualified roofer that Graham Nigel Giles employed to do our roof on our roof who admitted to us when asked that he had never done roofing before and that he was indeed a chef . The whole roof has had to be fully removed black to the rafters by a professional roofer who is doing a full report along with photos on Graham Nigel Giles Unprofessional shoddy work. Graham Giles did not build the rear dorma warm deck roof correctly and to disguise the fact that he did not know what he was doing he applied a self levelling latex cement meant for floors to the roof . This has all had to be removed ( we have all the photos and messages to back this up ). We then caught Graham Nigel Giles Watching a video on you tube on how to apply an EPDM Rubber roof. We recorded him doing this. Then we noticed the roof sagging on the extension only to discover he had not built supporting walls as per the plans he was supposed to be following and instead had just tried to support a whole roof with a small timber ladder. We have photos and recording of conversations with him ). Graeme Giles used used the wrong soakers twice on the roof 1st alloy ones and then lead ones even though he was questioned repeatedly he was adamant that it was right. However you cannot use soakers of any description on a roof with profiled tiles. We have all the messages relating to this. Graham Giles fitted a soak away into the garden which was much small than the minimum size required as per the plans and not the required distance from the house or depth and he then filled it all in without attaching any pipe work to it or the house. This has had to be dug up and a much larger one installed in the right way and place. Graeme Giles did not fit the ridge beam correctly and the engineer as deemed his work as slap dash. Graeme Giles was supposed to fit fireproof plasterboard on the ceiling in the garage and carport as per the plans but instead he fitted non fireproof OSB board. As you can see this is a total disaster all down to Graeme Giles fraudulent misrepresentation of himself , a representation that we relied on and we would like to take legal action against him personally to recoup our costs from him directly. Another customer has contacted us who is also seeing him for similar problems relating to his work. During the time Graeme Giles was here he caused damage to other areas of our property also in the process of working : The front door and frame which was brand new he dropped tiles on it from the roof , damaged the side glass in the frame, damaged the non removable rubbers on the frame. He hit the new rear patio doors with a digger causing damage. He hit our new front gates with the digger putting a hole in them. He broke our TV aerial. He damaged the front bay window sill when grinding metal nails out . He dropped a hammer onto our newly fitted tiled floor . One of his workers fell through the roof on our newly renovated annexe. He damaged both upstairs front new windows by putting planks through them to stand on . He damaged the new front facials when building the porch. He dropped heavy wood onto the newly fitted bathroom tile causing some of them to crack. He caused water to come through the newly fitted kitchen ceiling where pipe was not connected properly. In the process of working here he damaged every new ceiling that we had had done prior to him arriving on our property .Also due to the fact that he did not build the supporting walls and the roof was sagging he put acroe supports up to hold the roof up just days before telling us he was not coming back . He put the acroe supports on top of ply wood on the concrete floor and I tripped over the wood under his acroe support as with the pressure on it it had curled up at the side. I fell and hit my jaw on 09/01/2021 and ended up in hospital. I was treated for a hairline jaw fracture, but only yesterday I had to go back for a CT scan as I am still in a lot of pain and cannot eat properly. I also cut my leg when I tripped over the builders acroe. We have attached some photo,s showing the all the damage done by Graeme Nigel Giles but can send you more if you require. We contacted him immediately on my release from hospital regarding the injury to my jaw and the damage they caused to our home. They contacted their Insurance Company to advise them of a claim . Their Insurance - ( Lansdown Woodward , Princes Court, Princes Road, Dorset BH229JG / reference LW/Ringwoodbuilding Telephone - 01202 874989 ) we have a copy of the insurance Graeme Giles gave to us. Also due to the corona virus since March 2020 we have had a loss of our Airbnb income and believe we are covered for that.",PLINJURY

For the last few days there has been a strong smell of sewage in the house which is very noticeable when you come from outside and seems to be coming from around the downstairs toilet/ shower room. We use this regularly and have tried thoroughly cleaning but are concerned there is a burst pipe somewhere underneath or a blocked drain. It seems to be more pungent when the shower is on or has been on. We also noticed that the internal wall on the other side of the shower to the room has a hole which has just formed as it was so soft and damp so think the two may be connected. We have four small children one of whom is autistic with sensory issues and can’t stand the smell so would appreciate any help we can get ASAP.  Thank you,BLOCKEDDRAINS

"On Tuesday 20/07/21 an incident occurred in which my vehicle was broken into and my possessions stolen. I was attending the UFC gym in Nottingham. The parking used for gym members is the paid NCP car park on Union road NG3 1FG. I entered the car park at 20:46, after parking I made my way to the gym. I returned at 22:40 to find my rear passenger side window behind the driver was smashed. My vehicle at the time contained a brown bag in the footwell behind the drivers seat. This was stolen. As my civil wedding day was on 17th July 2021, I had in that brown bag my wedding suit, wedding shoes, 2 designer ties, Nike tracksuit, trainers and a perfume. The front of my vehicle was also rummaged through and in the glove compartment of my vehicle, I had my apple AirPods and a TAG Heur watch which my wife gifted me on our wedding day. These items were also stolen from the vehicle. Although I was in complete shock I managed to call the police and reported the incident straight away to the police who gave me an incident number: 0946-20/07/2021. The police said they will contact me within a few days to discuss the incident, they did in fact call me yesterday (23/07/21) and gave me a crime reference number: 21000412258. I discussed everything that happened and they told me if they have any updates they will call me. The days waiting for police to call, I decided to get in touch with NCP who have given me an email address to contact in order to obtain CCTV footage of the incident in the car park. Myself and Nottinghamshire police have emailed for the footage and are awaiting a reply. The car park itself is secure and has a barrier system for entry and exit. For this reason I thought my vehicle would be safe and secure, my car is also factory tinted on all rear windows which means it would not have been visible to see through the vehicle from afar. I could not believe something like this would happen in a secure place like that, it has brought me and my wife’s world down as there was so much sentimental value to the possessions. We have been trying to look forward to our Asian wedding next weekend, but this incident has impacted our lives more than we think. I have myself been trying to obtain more CCTV from nearby stores in order to catch the person or persons who did this. Should I have any more updates I will contact you. Kind regards, Mr Odedra.

"Early this morning I discovered a leak in the kitchen, a substantial drip of water running down the wall from the RSJ beam across the ceiling. I have recently returned from being away for a few weeks at my Mum’s. My neighbour is a plumber so came over. On removing some of the boxing in of the RSJ he discovered the leak was substantial. The bathroom is above, so he removed the skirting  to check the pipe work. However this was dry, so he then cut a hole in the back of the RSJ boxing to try and gain access to the leak. Using a camera, he then discovered that the leak is coming from pipes that are running along the top of the RSJ.  The only way to gain access will require removing bricks above the RSJ. The plumber has drained my central heating and switched it off, so I have no hot water. The RSJ is supporting the original back of the house, as there is an extension which was done many years before I bought the property (2 years ago). This will require a builder to remove the existing top cupboards, the lighting, remove the entire boxing in and support the RSJ from underneath. There is substantial water damage to the gas hob, oven, bottom cupboards, floor, cupboard panels. The leak is still ongoing. ",ESCAPEWATER

"I came upstairs in the evening to find water dripping through one of the wooden beams from the roof. We are submitting our claim in the hope that the roof replacement may be covered by our insurance. The back story is that we put an offer in on our house in March 2021 which was accepted and we started the process of getting the building checked over by professionals. We appointed a Chartered Surveyor to carry out a full survey which was undertaken on 28th April 2021 which did not identify any major issues with the roof to suggest that it would require a full roof replacement. We finally completed and got the keys to our house on 10th August 2021 and there appeared to be no problems at all with the roof until 28th September 2021 when we had our first lot of heavy rain and noticed the dripping from the wooden beam. I immediately contacted local tradesmen for their opinions and quotes for fixing what we thought might be something as simple as qa missing tile. However we were given the bad news that the whole roof needed recovering with quotes coming in at around £18,000. As this issue was not identified by our full survey nor was it as a result of neglect on our part I hope that this may be covered under our policy. I can send over a PDF copy of the full survey if required and any other information you may need. Thank you ",STORM

"There's an internal leak at our property. We've had an engineer run a few tests on the leak and we noticed that when the internal stop clock was closed, the water meter outside stopped spinning round completely. When the hot water source was isolated, i.e. turned off, the water meter moved very slowly, thereby signifying a definite leak with the hot water pipe. However, as the water meter didn't stop completely, there may be a small leak with the cold water pipe also. We believe that the leak may be in the outhouse area because the external brickwork to the outhouse at the damp course level is damp. There are no internal signs of water damage so we cannot say definitively where the leak is located. However, our garden has been flooded",ESCAPEWATER

"During November 2021 we paid a building contractor Elite Building services to complete some repairs and maintenance to our property. In early December we discovered that very little work was taking place and the contractors had taken a large deposit from us. On The 4th of December 2021 we confronted the contractors as they had done almost no work.  We asked them to return some of our money as they hadn’t provided any goods. One of the men became violent and aggressive and threatened Mr Workman he began smashing the lights on the outside of our house with a hammer. One of the other men started ripping off the pieces of wood work from the front of our house that they were supposed to be repairing snapping the phone line in two.  We ran into our house to call the police but had to find a mobile phone as they he’d ripped down the telephone connection. We locked ourselves in the house but the men threw what we think were house bricks and rubble at our conservatory from the tiered garden. They then entered the conservatory and went about threatening us and smashed the three windows in the Conservatory before leaving.  Later that day after speaking to the police and securing the house we were advised to go and stay with family as they believed these men were dangerous and knew where we lived. Just before we left we realised how much damage they had done to the conservatory as the entire perimeter of the conservatory was gushing through the conservatory roof over all of our furniture, Carpet etc. We also later discovered they had stolen 3 of our CCTV cameras from under the eaves of our house after ripping off our garden gate to access the cables and cut them rendering some of the CCTV cameras inoperable.  We took some photos and left for our safety. Returning every day for an hour or so to try and clean up.  The smell of damp and water made the conservatory and parts of the house unusable.   Damage has been  Conservatory roof interior trim and electrics - Water damage  Conservatory Carpet and skirting boards water damage  6 seater oak Dinning table water  damage  Aqua Oak 5ft Aquarium water damage  Tv water damage Tv cabinet water damage  3 x internal windows smashed with hammers Wood burner and flue water damage and smashed with hammer 3x hik vision CCTV Cameras ripped off and stolen Side garden gate damaged CcTV wired cut 8n several places.   A local roofer a few doors away from our relatives that we had stopped with for a few days had heard about our situation and offered to get on the conservatory roof and replace the damaged sections of conservatory trims and smashed gutters that were causing the water ingress so that our home was water tight for Christmas but unfortunately the damage had been done to the entire contents of the conservatory and the 3 internal glass windows. We can’t thank this man enough for securing our home but we are left with the emotional impact of what has happened and many of our belongings ruined.  The situation has made us both extremely ill and run down, we have now both tested positive for Covid we think this situation has made us more vulnerable. ??

I took action to avoid this by mopping & hoovering up the  water using a wet hoover and then using a dehumidifier to draw any excess water out.  The kitchen wall cupboards have also began to bubble from the bottom which I’m guessing will be from the steam that was circulating the rooms. At the time I was very upset about what I had done as I have only had the kitchen 2 years and was to busy trying to clean up the water so I didn’t think of taking photos of it actually being flooded but I have photos to prove the damage to the cupboards and can provide further if needed. The damage will probably progress over time as steam from cooking will enter into the already delaminated cupboards and as the water continues to dry out. I have tried to take the photos best as possible but the finish on the cupboard makes it difficult to capture.",ADBUILDINGS

I quickly realised it had come off my finger, and spent an hour trying to find it on the sea bed around the area it was accidentally lost, but unfortunately I could not find it. Naturally it is very upsetting. I understand from rereading my insurance policy wording that I have up to £5000 worldwide personal possessions cover for specified items within my policy schedule (listed on my policy wording as personal possessions, including jewellery), and I believe this incident falls within my cover as 'a sudden or unintentional act caused by you'. I also have an LV Premier travel insurance policy, which covers up to £500 for a valuables claim, but the purchase price of the ring was £789.49, and therefore I would prefer to claim through my home insurance. I would however, if you advise me to do so, share the details of my travel insurance policy for you to request a shared contribution to the claim, or log the claim in another way.

This was per of a large house renovation project and our contract was with Lifestyle kitchens & bathrooms, who project managed everything including the skylight and I believe hired subcontractors to install it. I have informed them I will be making this claim as I believe they/their subcontractors are ultimately responsible for the damage.

I (Gerry Scott) left for work around 07:35 and my wife Rosey left at 07:47 ensuring all doors were locked and arming the burglar alarm system. A person approached the house and broke the leaded glass window to the side of the front door to reach in to the Yale type lock on the front door. We also have a high secrity mortice lock, so at this point he must have kicked the front door with considerable force. The lock held, but the Victorian age front door cracked and broke around the lock, allowing him to enter. The alarm sounded (after 20 seconds). We know he was in the house for less than 2 minutes and have provided some low resolution pictures from our internal security system to the police. So far, we don't believe that he has actually taken anything. Our neighbours heard the alarm and approached the house probably within a couple of minutes of hime leaving. They phoned me and I returned home by 09:00. We have reported to the police, crime ref INC-20220915-0504. 2 officers attended yesterday and told us a scene of crime person would attend yesterday. At the end of the afternoon, we had a call to say it would be today (Fri 16th). They have just attended and looked for fingerprints, DNA etc. I secured the broken window last night (with OSB board) and the door temporarily by fitting a new mortice lock higher up. and clamping the broken section. My concern is that the (Victorian pine) door may be structurally damaged and the (again original Victorian) leaded pane will need fixed properly. We will have a better look around now the scene of crime people have attended, but so far we can't see that anything has been stolen (the picture of the thief leaving show he's not carrying anything large).

In the recent bad weather we are getting water through our second bedroom wall which is the dividing wall (boundary) to our neighbours as we live in a terraced house. This mainly occurs during downpours, we don't notice water leaking when the rain is light. Our neighbour says they have no water coming through on their side of the property. To rectify the issue we paid for builders and roofers to come and fix what they thought was the issue. I have videos of this I can send over. Unfortunately due to the downpours we are still getting leaks so this hasn't fixed the source. We have also checked our loft and it is bone dry up there. We have done everything possible within our means to try and fix the problem and our roofer and builder both believe the cause of the leak is higher on the valley which is on our neighbours side of the boundary on the roof. We have engaged our neighbour about getting it fixed but without proof that is what is causing the leak they aren't willing to do anything but the only way to find the true source would be to strip the roof which majority would be on their side of the roof.  We need to get it fixed as a matter of urgency, the weather is getting worse and the damage to our property is getting worse too. Last night there was excessive water, a pool of water on our office floor. We put a fruit bowl down and that was full. The water has now started to leak through the ceiling to our downstairs kitchen, which again is newly renovated and fitted.  I have called the legal advice team as advised by you but they are not helping and so I am submitting this claim to get the matter fixed.",STORM

"The water supply to my house runs via approximately 400 metres of underground pipe from the meter and stop tap which are located by the road to the point where the water comes into the house. I was alerted to a leak in the water supply by an unusually high water bill and I contacted Bristol Water who sent out technicians on two occasions - first to check whether there was a leak and secondly to establish whether the leak was in the close proximity to the meter. They confirmed that there was a pipeline leak and that it was not in the immediate proximity to the meter. They informed me that as householder it was my responsibility to find the leak and to have it repaired and that I would be responsible for the cost of this work. They provided me with a list of “approved” contractors and from that list I have been in touch with 4 companies and contracted a company called Pipeline Services Ltd to carry out the work. Their fee is based on a daily charge of £680 plus VAT. This was the lowest fee from local companies on that list that had the capacity to carry out the work. They are now in the process of trying to identify the source of the leak. I have looked at the terms of my policy and these state that policy covers “all costs (without limit) for repairing or replacing any sudden and unforeseen damage over and above £500 (including any necessary architects' and surveyors' fees, removal of debris from the site and costs to meet municipal or local authority bye-laws), caused by water escaping from pipes, tanks or appliances, including finding and accessing the leak.” I shall be most grateful if you will confirm that my insurance will help to cover the costs I am incurring and guide me on how to make a claim.

My wife contacted the British Gas Homecare Service with whom we had a maintenance contract, and they sent one of their Dyno-rod plumbers to repair the  separated joint. In all he found two broken joints and a split in the copper pipe feeding the tank.

"On the date stated (or around that time), we noticed that the pressure of our cold water supply was lower than usual. We initially thought this was normal, but upon further inspection, we realised that the pipes were making a sound as if water was flowing through them. We turned off the power to the house to see if a pump was causing the issue, but the water continued to flow. We then turned off the stop cock inside the house, which reduced the sound, but the problem persisted. When we turned off the stop cock outside, the sound stopped completely.  Upon investigating further, we found a small puddle outside, even though it had not rained. A local builder came by and dug down to find a steel pipe with a hole in it. The builder informed us that the burst was likely caused by the cold weather and suggested we contact our insurance company. The builder will be returning tomorrow to temporarily fix the hole with tape, but a permanent solution is needed. They have advised that we should consider replacing the pipe with a new MDPE pipe. Note that the water was discovered to have been seeping through the wall and into the space under the floorboards. This was 1-2"" deep across the house.

As part of the roofing works, the firewall between our property and the one next door was rebuilt. The company who did the repointing noticed that part of the wall under the roof, just below the firewall, had started leaning outwards due to the roofers having ""pushed"" the brickwork in that corner a little outwards with the weight of the firewall. The  Contractor doing the repointing added some ""stitching"" to that part of the wall to make sure it was solid and stable. With the Wind and Rain in the last few days it seems like that corner of the wall has now pushed outwards a bit more, the fascia cracked a bit and we have had water leaking through that section of the roof/wall in the attic that came through the ceiling of one of the bedrooms and damaged the  ceiling plasterboard.

Me and my family checked the whole shed and found that my tilite wheelchair, a couple bottles of alcohol, an old sony laptop (that was in a laptop bag) and a pioneer car stereo was stolen. I then called the police around about 8:40 and informed them about what happened and they went on to tell me that the forensic team will call me. The forensic team called me and asked if the robbers had left anything behind or if there was any blood on the floor or anything that may help the investigation.

" Chris Bell from C & R Electrical began work on Fri 16th September 2022. In total almost £4000 was spent on updates to most of the electrics in my home. During this time whilst relocating my solar inverter box he broke it and agreed to fix/replace it. He confirmed that he would provide a safety certificate when all work was done, he didn't (his legal obligation). Months passed, he wasn't responding to my calls/texts. I instructed a second electrician to see if he could fix my solar inverter as a matter of urgency, this electrician advised me the work done by Chris Bell did not conform to regs and that before he touched anything he would need to do a EICR (electrical installations condition report). 46 items where listed, a catastrophic fail! I advised Chris Bell of my predictament, sending him the report. I advised him that he needed to put right what was wrong, fix/replace the inverter he broke and provide the safety certificate or pay £6000+ (2 quotes came in at this) to a registered electrician to do so instead. He refused to pay another party and said he would sort. I have been strongly advised by 4 electrician's and warwickshire building control that he is incompetent and should not come back to do the corrections. Almost 5 weeks ago he promised to check his diary and get back with a date to address matters. There has been no further contact from him. I have no option now but to pay a further £6k+ to another electrician.  In additional to this cost, i've also paid out £330 for the EICR, many hundreds lost in higher energy bills and no refund from the National grid due to not having solar energy for more than 6 months.

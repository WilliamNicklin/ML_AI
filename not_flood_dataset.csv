"I noticed water coming through the ceiling in the kitchen and lounge after I had showered. I had dropped a screwdriver in the shower the day before but could not see any damage.  As I could not see where the shower was leaking I called out a plumber and I thought I had submitted a claim last week but I have found out today that I hadn’t although it does state that a claim was closed on 16th October but it wouldn’t let me add photos.  The plumber came to repair it on Friday but run out of time so is due back tomorrow.  However he told me I could still use my bath.  After using the bath last night, I came downstairs to find the lounge flooded and water dripping through the coving and light fitting.  The photos show the original damaged part that was leaking and the subsequent state of the situation now."

"Around 7.30pm yesterday my 5 year old turned the taps on the bath on and didn’t tell me. We didn’t realise until the water was pouring through the light socket and the electrics shorted. We immediately turned the taps off and drained the bath. The water continued to pour through the lights and then the ceiling collapsed under the weight of the water. Both taps had been running full force for approx 30 minutes. There is now a huge hole in the living room ceiling where the plasterboard bowed under the weight and all the flooring is ruined. The floor boards in the bathroom are swollen and the Lino is bubbling. I did call an emergency number at Frontier last night but I have received no confirmation of my call via email and the person didn’t even ask for my policy number so I have no idea if this claim is covered or is being looked into.  Please could you get in touch with me to confirm. Thank you. 07525537956"

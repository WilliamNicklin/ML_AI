I noticed water coming through the ceiling in the kitchen and lounge after I had showered. I had dropped a screwdriver in the shower the day before but could not see any damage.  As I could not see where the shower was leaking I called out a plumber and I thought I had submitted a claim last week but I have found out today that I hadn’t although it does state that a claim was closed on 16th October but it wouldn’t let me add photos.  The plumber came to repair it on Friday but run out of time so is due back tomorrow.  However he told me I could still use my bath.  After using the bath last night, I came downstairs to find the lounge flooded and water dripping through the coving and light fitting.  The photos show the original damaged part that was leaking and the subsequent state of the situation now

Arrived at the property to find surface water in kitchen area and water running from a pipe in the under sink cupboard. Upon further investigation extensive water pooling under all kitchen units, under tiling in kitchen/dining room. utility room and downstairs toilet. The dining room/playroom is very flooded and the carpet is showing approximately 1cm of water on the surface. The skirting boards in all affected rooms are warped and water damage is evident. The kitchen units are also warped and showing extensive water damage (confirmed by plumber who attended to fix the leak). One of the legs from the kitchen sink unit has buckled and is no longer supporting the unit, this was caused by the water damage.

Around 7.30pm yesterday my 5 year old turned the taps on the bath on and didn’t tell me. We didn’t realise until the water was pouring through the light socket and the electrics shorted. We immediately turned the taps off and drained the bath. The water continued to pour through the lights and then the ceiling collapsed under the weight of the water. Both taps had been running full force for approx 30 minutes. There is now a huge hole in the living room ceiling where the plasterboard bowed under the weight and all the flooring is ruined. The floor boards in the bathroom are swollen and the Lino is bubbling. I did call an emergency number at Frontier last night but I have received no confirmation of my call via email and the person didn’t even ask for my policy number so I have no idea if this claim is covered or is being looked into.  Please could you get in touch with me to confirm. Thank you. 07525537956

We have had a leakage issue that has occurred with the shower, this issue has flooded the bathroom due to a resident taking around a 5 minute shower. The leak has flooded through to the underside of the house and has leaked through to the kitchen below. One of the lights in the kitchen has water damage and this has caused a serious concern for structural damage. We have photographs and videos of the leak coming through the ceiling from the bathroom.

We heard a loud bang and sound just before 6 am and the smoke alarm was  alarming weirdly, I could hear splashing and I got up quickly to notice water flowing under neath the bathroom door in my bedroom on the 2nd floor and water was cashing out from the base of the towel radiator rack. My kids also woke up screening as the smoke alarm outside their bedroom had water pouring out of it and the down the landing near stairs was another pool of water. I quickly turned the water off , boiler off and the mains electricity for safety while I tried to established what was going on . As it is we have not water or electricity and we have just woken up now because of this . We urgently need help and the on all person could not immediately assist  me without me typing this inorder to access my account. It looks like a burst pipe or water leak somewhere which caused this sudden flooding on two floors causing damage to my ceiling on the landing and possible my floors in my bedroom and landing corridor
